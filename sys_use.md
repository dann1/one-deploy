# Using the Playbooks

## GitHub Project

The easiest way to use the playbooks is by cloning the [GitHub project](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-deploy.git). Throught out this documentation we will refer to several files in the project tree and assume they are avialble to you.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-deploy.git
```

## Ansible Galaxy Collection

For more advance users, the playbooks are available as part of the [Ansible Galaxy community site](https://galaxy.ansible.com/opennebula/cloud), just take a look at the documentation of each role in the OpenNebula collection to include them in your own playbooks.
